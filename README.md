# GameStop-Trend-Analysis

Way Finder has been approached by an investment brokerage company for the
outsourcing of the insights that can contribute to its decision-making process. The client
is currently working on a project for the development of an online brokerage application
that targets budding stock market investors on the horizon. Decisions include the
priorities of the platform the application needs to be developed, the target market to
start with, and the decisions related to the marketing strategies. Way Finder has longstanding
experience in social media trend analytics, gathering insights, and building
effective dashboards for major clients in the retail and wholesale banking, investment
firms and product-based industries. In this report, Way Finder identifies important stock
market trends from Twitter in the past 8 days and preprocesses them to form a corpus.
#GameStop short squeeze phenomenon that happened at the start of this year is
considered as a reference to identify twitter trends during exponential stock price
surges. The corpus is then used to create graphs and identify patterns and trends.
Analyses are further done to discover how these individual trends can be related. Key
Performance Indicators are then combined to form two main dashboards namely
GameStop Stock Trends and User Influence. The dashboards can be used to effectively
track the investor behavior on Twitter to act as an input to the clientâ€™s decision-making
process.
